# Advent Of Code 2024

Code and solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](http://adventofcode.com/2025) - just quite likely not very good ones :) Hey, it's just a bit of fun afterall.

The code relating to each day of advent is held in its own folder within this repository. Note that the inputs for each of the days may be unique to my user, and therefore the inputs to each of the days may need to be tweaked to run for your input. However, the code should hopefully be valid for your input.

Each day has two parts to it. Generally the 2nd part is a variation of the 1st part. I've broken the solutions for each part out into their own individual python files just for clarity.

**Note:** The code may not be particularly pythonic, or even always that legible. I may, dependant on time, go back and tidy the code up later. However, I'm using the competition as a distraction from normal coding duties, so don't hold your breath.

**Note:** This year (and presumably going forwards) there will only be 12 tasks. See [about](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) for details.

This year was discussed on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46096337) on November 30th, 2025.

As with last year DJ Veloxx will be doing a 3 hour set [on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/veloxxmusic) across the release of day 1's puzzle. (See [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1p7q36k/psa_live_housetechnotrance_dj_veloxx_will_be_on/))
