# Advent Of Code 2023

Code and solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](http://adventofcode.com/2023).
Just maybe not very good ones :)

The code relating to each day of advent is held in its own folder within this
repository. Note that the inputs for each of the days may be unique to my
user, and therefore the inputs to each of the days may need to be tweaked to
run for your input. However, the code should hopefully be valid for your
input.

Each day has two parts to it. Generally the 2nd part is a variation of the 1st
part. I've broken the solutions for each part out into their own individual
python files just for clarity.

**Note:** The code may not be particularly pythonic, or even always that legible.
I may, dependant on time, go back and tidy the code up later. However, I'm
using the competition as a distraction from normal coding duties, so don't
hold your breath.

## Leaderboard

I'm reusing my private [leaderboard](leaderboard.json) from previous years - even managed to get some new recruits to play this year!

## Puzzles

  * [Day 1 - Trebuchet?!](./day_01/README.md). Solved part 1 with a fairly simple digit matcher, and part 2 using a quick and dirty string look ahead. Inefficient (probably) but works on this kind of length of string well enough.
    * [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnidYOt9m2o) Jonathan Paulson solve it.
    * [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_us6npCcxw) William Y. Feng explain the problem.
    * [Reddit discussion page](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1883ibu/2023_day_1_solutions/)
    * The visualisations seemed to have started earlier this year:
        * A neat little [terminal visualisation](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1887jd2/2023_day_1_part_2_terminal_visualization/)
        * One that shows the [movements](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1885scv/2023_day_1_hither_and_yonder/) through the lines!
        * Someone built a new [website](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18396dj/2023_day_0_inspired_by_another_reddit_post_i_also/) for demonstrating their results in the style of Advent of Code.
        * A neat little [Browser Extension](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/17s0lq5/advent_of_code_charts_browser_extension_to/) that let's you see your private leaderboard in a slightly more interesting way.
  * [Day 2 - Cube Conundrum](./day_02/README.md). Fairly simple string manipulation (probably should have used a regex) and a little bit of maths checking.
    * [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWCc11nh2QQ) Jonathan Paulson solve it.
    * [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pILyGb8NznI) William Y. Feng explain the problem.
    * [Reddit discussion page](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/188w447/2023_day_2_solutions/)
    * Visualisations:
        * [Plot of the data](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189mh3w/2023_day_2_what_if_redgreenblue_were_xyz_and_i/) by x, y, z instead of colour.
        * [Video of the colours](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1890hhm/2023_day_2_part_2python_terminal_visualization/) as you process them.
  * [Day 3 - Gear Ratios](./day_03/README.md). That was a slightly awkward one, needing you to use a grid data structure to calculate.
    * [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz528600v-M) Jonathan Paulson solve it.
