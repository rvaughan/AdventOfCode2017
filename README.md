# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
competition run every December.

There's some videos by the creator [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl)):

While you wait for the challenges to unlock [VeloxxMusic](https://www.twitch.tv/veloxxmusic) has run an unlock party the past couple of years.

For now I've chosen to solve the puzzles using python, mainly for simplicity.

For those of you looking to use Rust as your solution language, there's [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEQv-cqzbPg) pretty good video from Chris Bascardi [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@chrisbiscardi) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi).

If you enjoy these then you might also like the [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/) from
the same author. I've also got a [code repository](https://github.com/rvaughan/synacor-challenge) for my paltry efforts at solving this puzzle.
