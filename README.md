# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
competition run every December.

There's some videos by the creator [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl)):

  * [Advent of Code: Behind the Scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFWuwNDOnIo)
  * [FOSDEM 2021 Talk](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem/2021/D.perl/adventofcode.webm)

For now I've chosen to solve the puzzles using python, mainly for simplicity.

If you enjoy these then you might also like the [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/) from
the same author. I've also got a [code repository](https://github.com/rvaughan/synacor-challenge) for my paltry efforts at solving this puzzle.
