# Advent Of Code 2020

Code and solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020).
Just maybe not very good ones :)

The code relating to each day of advent is held in its own folder within this
repository. Note that the inputs for each of the days may be unique to my
user, and therefore the inputs to each of the days may need to be tweaked to
run for your input. However, the code should hopefully be valid for your
input.

Each day has two parts to it. Generally the 2nd part is a variation of the 1st
part. I've broken the solutions for each part out into their own individual
python files just for clarity.

**Note:** The code may not be particularly pythonic, or even always that legible.
I may, dependant on time, go back and tidy the code up later. However, I'm
using the competition as a distraction from normal coding duties, so don't
hold your breath.

## Leaderboard

This year I set up a private [leaderboard](leaderboard.json).
